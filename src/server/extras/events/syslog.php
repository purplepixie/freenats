/* Description:
This is a custom event handler for FreeNATS v1 and relies on the following
event types: alert_action
It also relies on the following FreeNATS class methods:
TFreeNATS::Event, AddEventHandler
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Place into the server/base/site/events directory being sure to keep a .php
extension on the end of the file. Enable the system variable site.include.events
(set to 1) to enable inclusion.
Create an alert action of the type message queue and with the name "_syslog"
(without the quotes).
Alerts to this alert action will be piped to syslog.
Please note this may well not work when using the "test action" option in
the configuration dependent on your system security setup.

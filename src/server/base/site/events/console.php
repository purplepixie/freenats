/* Description:

This is a custom event handler for FreeNATS v1 and relies on the following
event types: alert_action

It also relies on the following FreeNATS class methods:
	TFreeNATS::AddEventHandler

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

Place into the server/base/site/events directory being sure to keep a .php
extension on the end of the file. Enable the system variable site.include.events
(set to 1) to enable inclusion.

Create an alert action of type message queue and the name "_console" (without
the quotes). Alerts to this action will be echo'd to the /dev/console device.

Note this will almost certainly never work for the "test" option owing to
security limitations but will work within a test cycle.
